## autosave

To enable autosaving in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) on your Mac M1, follow these steps:

1. **Open VSCode**: Launch the Visual Studio Code editor.

2. **Open Settings**: 
   - You can access the settings by clicking on the gear icon in the lower-left corner of the VSCode window and selecting "Settings" from the menu.
   - Alternatively, you can press `Cmd + ,` (Command + Comma) on your keyboard to open the settings directly.

3. **Search for Auto Save**: 
   - In the settings search bar at the top, type "auto save."
   - This will filter the settings to show options related to auto-saving.

4. **Enable Auto Save**: 
   - You will see an option called "Files: Auto Save." 
   - Click on the dropdown menu next to it and choose your preferred auto-save option:
     - `off`: Auto save is disabled.
     - `afterDelay`: Saves files automatically after a configured delay (default is 1000 ms).
     - `onWindowChange`: Saves files automatically when the editor window loses focus.
     - `onWindowChange`: Saves files automatically when the editor loses focus.
   
5. **(Optional) Set Auto Save Delay**: 
   - If you chose `afterDelay`, you can set the delay time (in milliseconds) for auto-saving by adjusting the "Files: Auto Save Delay" setting.

Once you have enabled and configured auto-saving, your changes will be saved automatically according to your selected option.
