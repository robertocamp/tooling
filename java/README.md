# Setting Up a Java Development Environment on Mac

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up a basic, functional Java environment on your Mac. Java is a versatile and widely-used programming language, and setting up your environment correctly is the first step toward productive development.

## 1. How to Install Java

###   do I already have Java ?

- `java -version`  --if this fails, you need to install java per instructions below

### Using Homebrew (Recommended)

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that makes it easy to install software.

1. **Install Homebrew** (if you haven’t already):


   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install Java**:

    PRE-STEP:  To quickly check if Java is already installed on your Mac, you can use the following command in your terminal: `java -version`



   ```bash
   brew install openjdk
   ```

3. **Add Java to your PATH**:
   After installation, you need to link Java to your system’s PATH. You can do this by adding the following line to your `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile` file:
   ```bash
   
    export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk
    export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"

   ```

   TO DO THIS IN VSCODE:    `code ~/.zshrc` , then add the "export" line from above

   THEN:  `source ~/.zshrc`

### Manual Installation (Alternative)

1. **Download the JDK**: Visit the [Oracle JDK download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html) or the [AdoptOpenJDK page](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) and download the installer for the latest version of Java.

2. **Install**: Follow the installation instructions in the downloaded package.

3. **Set JAVA_HOME**: Add the following to your `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`:
   ```bash
   export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
   export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
   ```

## 2.  validation 

- `which java`
- `java -version`


## VSCODE and  Java

To configure VSCode to recognize the Java environment on your Mac, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Java Extension Pack**:
   - Open VSCode.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing `Cmd+Shift+X`.
   - In the search bar, type "Java Extension Pack".
   - Install the "Java Extension Pack" by Microsoft, which includes essential extensions like `Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat`, `Debugger for Java`, `Java Test Runner`, and `Maven for Java`.

2. **Configure the Java Home**:
   - Ensure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is correctly set on your system.
   - You can check if it’s set by running the command `echo $JAVA_HOME` in the terminal.
   - If it’s not set, you can add it to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`):
     ```bash
     export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
     ```
   - Save the file and run `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile` to apply the changes.

3. **Open or Create a Java Project**:
   - Open an existing Java project or create a new one in VSCode.
   - If you create a new project, you can use the Java Extension Pack to create a new Java project by selecting `Java: Create Java Project` from the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`).

4. **Configure VSCode Settings**:
   - VSCode should automatically detect the Java environment if `JAVA_HOME` is correctly set.
   - You can adjust additional settings specific to your project in the `.vscode/settings.json` file, such as configuring the Java version or specific compiler settings.

5. **Run and Debug Java Code**:
   - You can run your Java code directly from VSCode by clicking the play button next to the `main` method or by right-clicking the file and selecting `Run Java`.
   - For debugging, set breakpoints in your code, and then click on the Debug icon on the side or press `F5` to start debugging.

This setup should allow you to develop, run, and debug Java applications efficiently in VSCode on your Mac.

## 3. How to Choose Which Version of Java to Install or Use

Different projects may require different versions of Java. Here’s how to manage this:

1. **Check Project Requirements**: Always check the project documentation for the required Java version.

2. **Using `jenv` to Manage Java Versions**:
   - Install `jenv`:
     ```bash
     brew install jenv
     ```
   - Add `jenv` to your shell startup file (`.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`):
     ```bash
     echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.jenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
     echo 'eval "$(jenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
     ```
   - Manage versions:
     ```bash
     jenv add $(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11)
     jenv global 11.0
     ```
   - You can switch between Java versions using:
     ```bash
     jenv global 17.0
     ```

## 4. Do I Need a Java Virtual Environment?

Java does not require a virtual environment like Python, but you can manage different versions using tools like `jenv`. This is particularly useful when working on multiple projects that require different Java versions.


## 5. VScode extension for Java

Best VS Code Extension for Java on Mac
The Extension Pack for Java is the generally recommended choice for developing Java applications in Visual Studio Code on a Mac. This pack includes a collection of essential extensions that provide a robust development environment:

Language Support for Java™ by Red Hat: Offers core Java language features like code completion, debugging, refactoring, and more.
Debugger for Java: Enables debugging of Java applications within VS Code.
Test Runner for Java: Executes and manages Java tests.
Maven for Java: Supports Maven projects.

Visual Studio IntelliCode: Provides AI-powered code completion suggestions.
Installation
To install the Extension Pack for Java, open VS Code, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), search for "Extension Pack for Java", and click Install.





## 6. Creating a Basic "Hello World" Program

Once Java is installed, you can create and run a simple Java program:

1. **Create a Directory for Your Project**:
   ```bash
   cd tooling/java
   mkdir HelloWorld
   cd HelloWorld
   ```

2. **Create a Java File**:
   ```bash
   touch HelloWorld.java
   ```

3. **Write Your Code**:
   Open `HelloWorld.java` in your favorite text editor and add the following code:
   ```java
   public class HelloWorld {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           System.out.println("Hello, World!");
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Compile the Program**:
   ```bash
   javac HelloWorld.java
   ```

5. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   java HelloWorld
   ```

   You should see the output:
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```

## Summary

You’ve now set up a Java development environment on your Mac, learned how to manage different Java versions, and created a simple "Hello World" program. This setup will allow you to start developing Java applications or learning the language.
