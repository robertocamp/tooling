# AWS AMPLIFY

## pre-requisite: node

Yes, you can check if Node.js is already installed on your machine by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

This command will display the version of Node.js installed on your system if it's already installed. Similarly, you can check if npm (the Node.js package manager) is installed by running:

```bash
npm -v
```

If both commands return version numbers, Node.js is already installed on your machine, and you don't need to install it again. You can proceed with installing the Amplify CLI using npm.


## INSTALL NODE AND NPM IF NEC

Yes, using `brew` (Homebrew) to install Node.js and npm on your Mac is a common and effective method. Here's a step-by-step guide following best practices:

### 1. Install Node.js and npm
Homebrew installs both Node.js and npm together, so you don't need to install npm separately.

```bash
brew install node
```

### 2. Verify Installation
After the installation is complete, you can verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly:

```bash
node -v
```
This command should return the installed Node.js version.

```bash
npm -v
```
This command should return the installed npm version.

### 3. Update Node.js and npm
Homebrew makes it easy to update Node.js and npm to the latest versions:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade node
```

### 4. Avoid Using `sudo` with npm
Itâ€™s a good practice to avoid using `sudo` with npm to install global packages. Instead, you can set up npm to install global packages in your home directory.

```bash
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
```

Next, add the following line to your `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile` file to ensure your shell knows where to find the globally installed npm packages:

```bash
export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
```

Reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
or
```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Now, you can install global npm packages without `sudo`.

### 5. Install `n` for Node Version Management (Optional but Recommended)
If you need to manage multiple versions of Node.js, you can use a version manager like `n`:

```bash
npm install -g n
```

With `n`, you can easily switch between different versions of Node.js:

```bash
n latest
```

Or install a specific version:

```bash
n 16.14.0
```

### Summary
By following these steps, you ensure that Node.js and npm are installed in a way that avoids permission issues and allows for easy updates. Additionally, using a version manager like `n` can help you manage different Node.js versions efficiently.

## install Amplify CLI

The `amplify init` command is part of the AWS Amplify CLI, which is a toolchain used to create, configure, and manage AWS services for your application. AWS Amplify provides a set of tools and services to help you build full-stack applications, including backend services like authentication, storage, and APIs, which can be integrated with your Flutter project.

To resolve the "command not found" error, you'll need to install the Amplify CLI on your machine. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install Node.js**: The Amplify CLI is a Node.js package, so you need to have Node.js installed. You can install Node.js using Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```

2. **Install the Amplify CLI**: Once Node.js is installed, you can install the Amplify CLI globally using npm (the Node.js package manager):

   ```bash
   npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
   ```

3. **Verify the Installation**: After the installation is complete, verify that the Amplify CLI is installed correctly by running:

   ```bash
   amplify --version
   ```

   This should display the installed version of the Amplify CLI.

4. **Run `amplify init`**: Now, you can navigate to the root of your Flutter project and run the `amplify init` command:

   ```bash
   amplify init
   ```

   This command will guide you through the process of setting up a new Amplify project. You'll be asked to provide information like the name of the project, environment, and AWS configuration.
