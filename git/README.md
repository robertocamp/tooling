# git

To determine if Git is installed on your Mac M1, you can use the Terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git --version
```

If Git is installed, this command will return the installed version of Git, for example:

```
git version 2.40.1
```

If Git is not installed, your Mac will prompt you to install the Xcode Command Line Tools, which include Git. You can follow the on-screen instructions to install it if needed.
