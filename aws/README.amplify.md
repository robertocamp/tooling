# AWS AMPLIFY

## pre-requisite: node

Yes, you can check if Node.js is already installed on your machine by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

This command will display the version of Node.js installed on your system if it's already installed. Similarly, you can check if npm (the Node.js package manager) is installed by running:

```bash
npm -v
```

If both commands return version numbers, Node.js is already installed on your machine, and you don't need to install it again. You can proceed with installing the Amplify CLI using npm.


## install Amplify CLI

The `amplify init` command is part of the AWS Amplify CLI, which is a toolchain used to create, configure, and manage AWS services for your application. AWS Amplify provides a set of tools and services to help you build full-stack applications, including backend services like authentication, storage, and APIs, which can be integrated with your Flutter project.

To resolve the "command not found" error, you'll need to install the Amplify CLI on your machine. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install Node.js**: The Amplify CLI is a Node.js package, so you need to have Node.js installed. You can install Node.js using Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install node
   ```

2. **Install the Amplify CLI**: Once Node.js is installed, you can install the Amplify CLI globally using npm (the Node.js package manager):

   ```bash
   npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
   ```

3. **Verify the Installation**: After the installation is complete, verify that the Amplify CLI is installed correctly by running:

   ```bash
   amplify --version
   ```

   This should display the installed version of the Amplify CLI.

4. **Run `amplify init`**: Now, you can navigate to the root of your Flutter project and run the `amplify init` command:

   ```bash
   amplify init
   ```

   This command will guide you through the process of setting up a new Amplify project. You'll be asked to provide information like the name of the project, environment, and AWS configuration.
