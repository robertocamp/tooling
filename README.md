# Tooling, Configuration and Environment


I am creating a git repository to help junior backend software developers ensure that their Mac environments are setup to do basic productive work in various software and cloud computing environments.

So far my project looks like this:

```
.
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── aws
│   └── README.md
├── dart
│   └── README.md
├── git
│   └── README.md
├── go
│   └── README.md
├── java
│   └── README.md
└── python
    └── README.md
```

I would like to start with the Java/README.md file.

Since I am not particularly strong in Java, I would like to document how to setup a basic functional Java environment for someone working on a Mac.

Can you help me create content in this subject for me java/README.md file?

Some basic questions I think the README.md should answer are:

How do I install Java?

How do I know which version of Java to install or to use?

Does local Java development require a Java virtual environment?

Once we Java installed locally, how would we create a basic "Hello World" program?
