# Python Excel and CSV 

## MS excel files

Yes, it is possible to install Microsoft Excel on a MacBook Pro with an M2 chip. Microsoft offers a version of Office 365, which includes Excel, that is compatible with Apple Silicon (M1, M2, etc.) processors. The software runs natively on these chips, ensuring optimal performance.

To install Excel on your MacBook Pro M2, you can do the following:

1. **Via Microsoft 365 Subscription:**
   - Purchase a Microsoft 365 subscription, which includes Excel.
   - Go to [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365) and log in with your account.
   - Download the Office installer package and follow the on-screen instructions to install Excel along with other Office apps.

2. **Via Mac App Store:**
   - Open the Mac App Store on your MacBook Pro.
   - Search for "Microsoft Excel" and click "Get" to download and install the app. Note that this may prompt you to sign in with a Microsoft account and potentially purchase a subscription.

3. **One-time Purchase:**
   - You can also purchase a one-time license for Microsoft Office (Office Home & Student or Office Home & Business) from Microsoft or authorized retailers, which allows you to install Excel and other Office apps.

Once installed, Excel will run efficiently on your M2 MacBook Pro.

## Basic Python for CSV/EXCEL


You don't need to convert the `.xlsx` file to a CSV format; Python can open and work with `.xlsx` files directly using libraries like `pandas` and `openpyxl`. Here's how you can do it:

### 1. Install the Necessary Libraries

If you haven't already installed `pandas` and `openpyxl`, you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

### 2. Open and Read the `.xlsx` File

You can use `pandas` to read the `.xlsx` file directly:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the Excel file
df = pd.read_excel("final.xlsx", engine='openpyxl')

# Display the first few rows of the dataframe
print(df.head())
```

### Explanation:

- **`pd.read_excel("final.xlsx", engine='openpyxl')`**: This command reads the `.xlsx` file into a `pandas` DataFrame, which you can then manipulate for data analysis.
- **`engine='openpyxl'`**: The `engine` parameter specifies the engine to use for reading the Excel file. `openpyxl` is commonly used for `.xlsx` files.

### 3. Perform Data Analysis

Once the file is loaded into a DataFrame, you can perform various data analysis tasks using `pandas` like filtering, aggregation, visualization, etc.

### Example of a Simple Data Analysis

```python
# Get basic statistics
print(df.describe())

# Group by a column and get the mean
grouped_data = df.groupby('some_column').mean()
print(grouped_data)
```

This approach allows you to work with the Excel file directly in its native format without needing to convert it to CSV.
